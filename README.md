# 🚀 Career Pack

**The Resource Kit Every Developer Needs Before They Start Applying**

If you're a student or early-career developer, you already know the tech industry is competitive. But here's what most people don't tell you: **having the skills isn't enough**. You need to know how to present them.

Career Pack exists because too many talented developers get overlooked—not because they lack ability, but because they don't know how to showcase it. This collection cuts through the noise and gives you the exact frameworks, strategies, and templates that actually work in today's job market.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

You've spent countless hours learning to code, building projects, and solving problems. Don't let a poorly formatted resume or invisible LinkedIn profile be the reason you don't get the interview. 

The developers who land great roles aren't always the most skilled—they're the ones who know how to:
- Get past automated screening systems
- Write resumes that tell a story, not just list technologies
- Network strategically without feeling pushy
- Make recruiters come to them

This pack teaches you all of that.
